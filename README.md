Aide - short for legal aide - is a commandline tool that simplifies the management of your 
javascript projects' licensing dependencies. It assists you in enforcing license compliance, so 
that accidental inclusion of dependencies that may be dangerous to your project can be caught early.

WARNING: This tool is not a lawyer, and it does not constitute legal advice. Please seek your own
counsel for determining which configuration is appropriate for you.

* aide init
